## Notes

- The XOR patch enhances obfuscation for OpenVPN connections, making traffic harder to detect by DPI (Deep Packet Inspection).
- Ensure your firewall and network settings are properly configured to allow OpenVPN traffic.

For more details, refer to the [Angristan OpenVPN GitHub repository](https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, consult the OpenVPN logs and ensure dependencies are installed:

```bash
sudo systemctl status openvpn
journalctl -xe
```
The OpenVPN service has been created and enabled.
You can start it with: systemctl start openvpn@server
Make sure you have created the server configuration file at /etc/openvpn/server.conf before starting the service.
